Welcome to Regression Expert! To run the software, you can either fork a copy onto Replit, or fork a copy onto your code editor.

## Notes for forking to Code Editor
A few steps need to be followed for the code to work:
- Change index.js import statements
- Have Node.js installed and connected to your code editor
- Run the command `npm install express sqlite3 ejs`
And you should be set!
